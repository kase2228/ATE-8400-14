          <h3>Our Hospital Rooms</h3>
          <p>
            Our 80 hospital rooms are designed to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment for our patients. We understand that being in the hospital can be a stressful and sometimes scary experience, which is why we have created rooms that promote healing and relaxation.
            <br><br>
            Our rooms are designed to accommodate different patient needs. All of our rooms are cleaned and sanitized regularly to ensure that they remain sterile and free of germs.
            <br><br>
            We also offer a range of amenities to make your stay in the hospital as comfortable as possible. Our rooms are equipped with adjustable beds, comfortable seating, and ample space to move around.
